# 📊 Loan Performance & Lending Insights

## 📌 Introduction

The financial sector is heavily reliant on data-driven decision-making
to evaluate lending performance, minimize risks, and ensure sustainable
growth.\
This case study focuses on the analysis of **loan applications, funded
amounts, repayments, and borrower profiles**.\
By defining **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** and visual analytics,
the study provides insights into loan quality, repayment patterns, and
borrower characteristics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🏦 Problem Statement

Banks and financial institutions manage large volumes of loan
applications every month.
However, decision-makers often face challenges such as: - Identifying
patterns in loan disbursements and repayments.
- Distinguishing between **good loans** (profitable, reliable borrowers)
and **bad loans** (risky, default-prone borrowers).
- Understanding how borrower attributes such as **region, employment
length, and loan purpose** affect loan quality.
- Tracking cash flow health through repayment monitoring.

👉 This case aims to address these issues by developing **KPI-driven
dashboards** and analytics for effective monitoring.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Business Requirements & KPIs

### **BRD 1: Summary Metrics**

-   **Total Loan Applications** -- Count of applications over a defined
    period (with Month-to-Date values).
-   **Total Funded Amount** -- Total value of loans disbursed (with MTD
    tracking).
-   **Total Amount Received** -- Repayments collected from borrowers
    (including MTD).
-   **Average Interest Rate** -- Mean interest charged across loans.
-   **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)** -- Indicates borrower
    financial health.

#### ✅ Good Loan KPIs

-   Good Loan Application %
-   Number of Good Loan Applications
-   Good Loan Funded Amount
-   Good Loan Total Received Amount

#### ❌ Bad Loan KPIs

-   Bad Loan Application %
-   Number of Bad Loan Applications
-   Bad Loan Funded Amount
-   Bad Loan Total Received Amount

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **BRD 2: Visual Analytics Overview**

The following dashboards/charts are proposed: 1. 📈 **Monthly Trends by
Issue Date (Line/Area Chart)** -- Identifies seasonality and long-term
lending activity.
2. 🌍 **Regional Analysis by State (Bar Chart)** -- Highlights regions
with high or low loan activity.
3. 🥧 **Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart)** -- Shows distribution across
different term lengths.
4. 👔 **Employment Length Analysis (Bar Chart)** -- Studies how
employment history impacts loan performance.
5. 🎯 **Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart)** -- Breaks down loans by
purpose (debt consolidation, education, etc.).
6. 🏡 **Home Ownership Analysis (Tree/Heat Map)** -- Hierarchical view
of homeownership impact on loans.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔎 Analytical Approach

-   **Data Extraction & Cleaning** -- Collect loan records, borrower
    profiles, repayment logs.
-   **KPI Computation** -- Calculate application counts, funded amounts,
    repayments, and ratios.
-   **Segmentation** -- Classify loans into **Good** and **Bad** based
    on repayment status.
-   **Visualization** -- Build dashboards for real-time monitoring and
    decision-making.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

1.  **Improved Decision-Making** -- Clear visibility into loan
    performance.
2.  **Risk Mitigation** -- Early identification of bad loans.
3.  **Operational Efficiency** -- Automated KPI monitoring.
4.  **Strategic Insights** -- Better understanding of borrower behavior
    for product optimization.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ✅ Conclusion

This case study demonstrates how **data analytics in lending** can
transform raw loan data into **actionable insights**.
By leveraging KPIs, good vs bad loan segmentation, and visual
dashboards, financial institutions can **reduce risk, enhance
profitability, and optimize lending strategies**.
